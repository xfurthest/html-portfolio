<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Yo! What up my glip glops! You're growing up fast, Morty. You're going into a
  great big thorn straight into my ass. My man! He's not a hot girl. He can't
  just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's.

  Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh yeah you
  can't. They blew up. Oh god, oh, I blame myself. Oh, what a tragedy. Oh, well,
  he's bones now. I guess all debts are paid. What are you looking at, mother
  fucker! If it were, you could call ME Ernest Hemingway.

<p>
  Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different?
  No more dad, Morty. I dunno, some people would pay top dollar for that kind of
  breakthrough. Oh good job Morty! You killed my best customer but you saved a
  mind reading fart!
